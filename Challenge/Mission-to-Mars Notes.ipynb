    "\n",
    "In this module, you'll automate a web browser to visit different websites to extract data about the Mission to Mars. You'll store it in a NoSQL database, and then render the data in a web application created with Flask. The completed work will be displayed in your portfolio, which you will also create.\n",
    "\n",
    "Web scraping is a method used by organizations worldwide to extract online data for analysis. Large companies employ web scraping to assess their reputations or track their competitors' online presence.\n",
    "\n",
    "On a smaller scale, web scraping automates tedious tasks for personal projects. For example, if you're collecting current news on a specific subject, web scraping can make it a simple process. Instead of visiting each website and copying an article, a web scraping script will perform those actions and save the scraped data for later analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What You Will Learn\n",
    "By the end of this module, you will be able to: \n",
    "\n",
    "- Gain familiarity with and use HTML elements, as well as class and id attributes, to identify content for web scraping.\n",
    "- Use BeautifulSoup and Splinter to automate a web browser and perform a web scrape.\n",
    "- Create a MongoDB database to store data from the web scrape.\n",
    "- Create a web application with Flask to display the data from the web scrape.\n",
    "- Create an HTML/CSS portfolio to showcase projects.\n",
    "- Use Bootstrap components to polish and customize the portfolio.\n",

    "<i> Robin is pretty excited about putting together this web-scraping project. Being able to get the latest news and updates with the click of a button? That's a really useful tool for someone who wants to keep up with the Mission to Mars.\n",
    "\n",
    "First things first, though—preparation. Robin needs to download a few libraries and tools that she'll need when she's ready to start scraping data: Splinter to automate a web browser, BeautifulSoup to parse and extract the data, and MongoDB to hold the data that has been gathered.</i>\n",
    "\n",
    "With all of the information available on the web, people are able to stay up-to-date with almost every subject out there. What if a person wants to narrow their focus to a single topic? Are there tools that would make gathering the latest data easier?\n",
    "\n",
    "Robin, who loves astronomy and wants to work for NASA one day, has decided to use a specific method of gathering the latest data: web scraping. Using this technique, she has the ability to pull data from multiple websites, store it in a database, then present the collected data in a central location: a webpage\n",
    "\n",
    "![flask](https://courses.bootcampspot.com/courses/691/files/604614/preview)\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Before installing new tools, open your terminal and make sure your Python coding environment is active.</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Splinter\n",
    "Splinter is the tool that will automate our web browser as we begin scraping. This means that it will open the browser, visit a webpage, and then interact with it (such as logging in or searching for an item). To do all of this, we'll need to install Splinter and ChromeDriver.\n",
    "- To install Splinter, open your terminal and make sure your coding environment is active. Then, run the command <code>pip install splinter</code>. Once that installation is complete, we'll install ChromeDriver.\n",
    "    - IMPORTANT: To successfully use the ChromeDriver and scrape website data, a separate package will need to be installed into our virtual environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Web-Driver Manager\n",
    "The web driver manager package will allow us to easily use a driver  to scrape websites without having to go through the complicated process of installing the stand alone ChromeDriver.\n",
    "- To install the manager make sure your are still in your active coding environment and run the command <code>pip install webdriver_manager</code>.\n",
    "\n",
    "### BeautifulSoup\n",
    "To install BeautifulSoup, run the command <code>pip install bs4</code> in your terminal. Make sure the environment you plan to work from is active first.\n",
    "\n",
    "## MongoDB\n",
    "MongoDB (also known as Mongo) is a document database that thrives on chaos. Well, maybe it's not that extreme, but it is far more flexible when it comes to storing data than a structured database such as SQL. It's able to handle smaller, more personal projects as well as larger-scale projects that a company might require. For this module, Mongo is a better choice than SQL because the data we'll scrape from the web isn't going to be uniform. For example, how would we break down an image into rows and columns? We can't. But Mongo will store and access it as a document instead.\n",
    "- To install PyMongo, first open a terminal window (make sure your virtual environment is active) and execute the \"pip install pymongo\" command. \n",
    "\n",
    "     <b>PyMongo is the tool that allow developers to use Python with Mongo.</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Installation\n",
    "To install Mongo on your macOS computer, follow the instructions in the official documentation. Be sure to follow all of the steps listed for installing the MongoDB Community Edition.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are a few important tips during this installation:\n",
    "- It's best to use the Homebrew <code>brew</code> package for this installation. In your terminal, the installation command will start with <code>brew tap</code>.\n",
    "- Once Mongo is installed, we want to run it as a macOS service because doing so will automatically set system ulimit values correctly.\n",
    "    - Mac users will use this line to create a database instance: <code>brew services start mongodb-community@4.4</code> instead of mongod.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### GITHUB\n",
    "Navigate to GitHub and create a new repository to hold the code for this module. Name the new repo \"Mission-to-Mars\" and clone it into your class folder. Remember to add, commit, and push your code as you work through the module.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Flask-PyMongo\n",
    "To bridge Flask and Mongo, you'll also want to install the (Flask-PyMongo)[https://flask-pymongo.readthedocs.io/en/latest/] library. \n",
    "- This library can be installed using pip and the following command from your terminal: <code>pip install Flask-PyMongo</code>.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Additional Libraries\n",
    "There are two final Python libraries required to run scraping code successfully: <b>html5lib</b> and <b>lxml</b>. Both packages are used to parse HTML in Python, which will be important as you traverse through different web pages to find and collect information.\n",
    "\n",
    "To install these libraries, first make sure your coding environment is active. Then, type the following commands in your terminal to install them:\n",
    "1. <code>pip install html5lib</code>\n",
    "2. <code>pip install lxml</code>"

    "# Opening the Window to the Internet\n",
    "## 10.2.1: Use HTML Elements\n",
    "<i>Robin has gotten all of her tools installed and tested Mongo to make sure it's ready for data, but before she can really start pulling it off of the web, she needs to be able to identify where the data is stored within the HTML code.</i>\n",
    "\n",
    "Every webpage is built using hypertext markup language, more commonly known as HTML. \n",
    "- Some sites are more sophisticated than others, but they all have the same basic structure. \n",
    "- Each element of a page, such as a title or a paragraph, is wrapped in a tag. \n",
    "    - Each tag is specific to the element it's holding, and there are many different types of tags.\n",
    "\n",
    "### HTML tags\n",
    "Think of a webpage as a window into the internet. HTML is the glass, boards, and blinds on that window. Just like there are many sizes and shapes to windows, each webpage has been customized to present users with a view into a different topic. (ie. a weather report delivered through a weather site, a news source or social media platform). Each of these examples are all built using custom HTML. \n",
    "\n",
    "Our first step will be to explore that design so that we can write a script that knows what it's looking at when it interacts with a webpage.\n",
    "- Open VS Code and create a file named index.html. This file can be saved to your desktop because it's just for practice.\n",
    "    - In this blank HTML file put an exclamation point on the first line and press Enter. This should autofill the editor to contain everything we need for a basic HTML page.\n",

    "- HTML tags always begin with a left angle bracket (<code><</code>) followed by the name of the tag (in our case, \"title\"). Once the name has been entered, the tag is then closed with a right angle bracket (<code>></code>). This is only the first half of the completed tag, or the opening tag. We'll also need to add the closing tag.\n",
    "    \n",
    "- A closing HTML tag is very similar to the opening tag, but the only difference is a single character, the forward slash inside the left angle bracket: `</title>` . Now that there are both opening and closing HTML title tags, you can add the title of the document.\n",
    "\n",
    "    For example, if you wanted your webpage title to be \"Math Is Fun!\" then the entire line of HTML code would look like this: `<title>Math Is Fun!</title>` .\n",
    "\n",
    "  **NOTE:**\n",
    "  Sometimes you'll see tags like this: `<title/>`. This isn't a new-fangled way of presenting HTML code, it's just a way of summarizing the tags and their contents. This is more commonly seen in written descriptors of HTML and not in live HTML code.\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll see different tags referred to in the same manner as you learn how to create and customize webpages.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### REWIND\n",
    "HTML is a coding language used for creating webpages. It’s built using specific tags and arranging them in a nested order, a bit like building blocks. \n",
    "- For example, if we wanted a header and a paragraph in the same section of a webpage, we would nest `<h1/>` and `<p/>` tags inside a `<div/>` tag, with the `<div/>` tag acting as a box to hold the other pieces.\n",
    "\n",
    "        <div>\n",
    "          <h1>Hello, world!</h1>\n",
    "          <p>This is a great beginning.</p>\n",
    "        </div>\n",
    "\n",
    "Most elements have opening and closing tags, which are identical except for the forward slash that begins the closing tag. The closing tags represent the end of that HTML element.\n",
    "These tags are what define each element of this webpage. We can open this page right now, but it will be blank because we haven't added anything to it yet. Let's take a closer look at how these different elements work together.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "`<!DOCTYPE html >` is a declaration, not a tag. It tells web browsers in which HTML version the document is written. **This should always be the first line in an HTML document.**\n",
    "\n",
    "`<head>` is the opening tag that serves as a container for the setup elements. Jupyter Notebook imports occur in the top cell whereas Python imports occur at the top of the code. HTML imports (e.g., a stylesheet or a library) will be within the `<head>`.\n",
    "\n",
    "`<meta>` is short for \"metadata\" and tells the web browser basic information, such as page width.\n",
    "\n",
    "`<title>` and `</title>` are the opening and closing tags that serve as a container for the page title displayed on the tab at the top of your web browser. In the example above, the title is \"Document.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "`</head>` is the closing tag for the `<head>` tag, much like the end of a code block in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "`<body>` and `</body>` are opening and closing tags. They also serve as a container, but for data we can see (navigation menus, lists, and paragraphs).\n",
    "\n",
    "`<html lang=”en” >` and `</html>` are opening and closing tags that serve as a container for all elements within an HTML page.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Nesting** is when HTML elements are contained within other elements. Picture a set of nesting dolls with each nested in proper order, by design, into the largest doll. It is the same for HTML tags—they must be in the correct order to not break the design of the webpage.\n",
    "\n",
    "An easy way to keep the tags in visual order is by using indentation. \n",
    "- Nested HTML code appears indented so it is easier to understand. \n",
    "- Containers nested within other containers are indented by **two to four** spaces. This helps to keep our code clean and easy to understand.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's take another look at this webpage, only with a few more elements added to it:\n",
    "\n",
    "    <!DOCTYPE html>\n",
    "    <html lang=\"en\">\n",

    "    </html>\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several more tags within the `<body/>` container. \n",
    "1. Add this new code to your index.html file and save it. \n",
    "2. Then, open the file by navigating to it and double-clicking it. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now you have a simple static webpage open in your browser, built from scratch. It's not super exciting yet, but that's okay. It's the innards of the page we're focusing on right now.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's review the new tags:\n",
    "\n",
    "`<h1/>` is a first-level header. The text in this tag will be displayed bigger and bolder than the rest of the page's text. There are many different headers available to use, from h1 to h6, with h1 returning the largest text.\n",
    "`<p/>` is a paragraph tag, currently holding lorem ipsum sentences. (lorem ipsum is dummy text used to stage websites). More can be read about it on the Lorem Ipsum reference website.\n",
    "`<ul/>` is an unordered list.\n",
    "`<li/>` is a list item.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is only a small taste of how many tags exist out there. Remember, these tags are all part of website customization. Without the variety available to use, websites would look plain and uninspired. The sites that Robin intends to scrape data from are far more sophisticated, using many more combinations of tags than what we've discussed here. Understanding the basic layout and how nesting and containers work is an important part of successful web scraping.\n",
    "\n",
    "We know that when we scrape data from the web, we're simply pulling specific data from websites we've chosen. How do we specify the data? Let's say we want the latest news article from a Mars website. Before we can program our script to pull that data, we have to tell it where to look. Basically, our script would say, \"look in this `<div/>` tag, then look inside that for a `<p/>` tag.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if the webpage was a window, we would use our script to direct it to a certain pane.\n",
    "- The script specifies that data should be pulled from the bottom center pane of the webpage.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once it found that pane, we can also tell it to look even closer, such as at the bottom-center pane.\n",
    "- The script specifies that data should be pulled from a selected spot within the bottom center pane of the webpage.\n",
    "\n",
    "That's a simple way of putting it, but we'll dive more deeply into how web scraping works soon. Visit W3Schools' developer site for an extensive list of ([HTML tags](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_comment.asp)). "

    "## 10.2.2: Using Chrome Developer Tools\n",
    "<em>Robin has installed all of her tools and researched different HTML tags in preparation for her web-scraping project. She's really ready to jump in and start gathering data, but even with her initial research, she realized she wasn't quite ready to start scraping. The HTML components on the first site she visited quickly became more complex than she expected.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead, Robin has decided to practice identifying specific data using Chrome Developer Tools (also known as DevTools). This tool allows developers to look at the structure of any webpage. Not only that, but there's a search function as well. This should help make more sense of the tags and components that hold the data she's looking for.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's visit one of the websites Robin plans to use and take a peek at its structure, then practice finding different components.</em>\n",
    "\n",
    "Robin wants to be kept up to date with different Mars news, and she's enjoyed the articles published on the NASA news website. For her project specifically she would like to extract the most recently published article's title and summary. Let's find the HTML components in the page so we can help her with that.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Start with opening the news site in a new browser window. \n",
    "   - At first glance, we can see that there are article titles and a quick sentence describing each article. \n",
    "     - Open the DevTools by right-clicking anywhere on the page, then click \"Inspect\" from the pop-up menu.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. After clicking \"Inspect,\" a new window should open under the webpage. \n",
    "   - This new window is docked to the webpage itself—it's part of the webpage, it's attached to the webpage, but it has a different job.\n",
    "   - There is a lot going on in this site. What we're currently looking at is how this news site is assembled. The `<html lang=”en”>` line should look familiar, as well as the `<head/>` and `<body/>` tags, but what is all of this other stuff? And the stuff inside the familiar tags? It's a good thing Robin wanted to take a deeper look at this webpage before trying to extract the data from it.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start breaking this down a bit. Remember how we spoke about containers? For example, the `<body>` tag is a container for every visual component of a webpage, such as headers and paragraphs. Inside that `<body/>` tag are other containers, which are nested much like a nesting doll. In the case of this website (and most websites), these other containers inside the body are `<div/>` tags.\n",
    "- There can be multiple levels of nesting, depending on how elaborate the website is.\n",
    "- Each container is nested within another, with multiple layers, depending on the complexity of the website.\n",
    "- Another perk of the DevTools is that if you hover over the code displayed in the window below, the connected visual is highlighted in the page above at the same time. This is helpful because it shows us which code is specifically tied to features of the website above.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a lot of custom code included in this website, so instead of scrolling through all of it to find a certain element, we will search for it instead. \n",
    "\n",
    "3. In your DevTools, press \"ctrl + f\" or \"command + f\" to bring up the search function. \n",
    "   1. Input \"gallery_header\" into the search bar then press enter. \n",
    "   2. Make sure the line \"header class=\"gallery_header\" is selected, then hover over it with your mouse pointer. \n",
    "   3. This will highlight the header section of the page: the title and its container element.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Hover over the next line of code, `<h2 class=\"module-title\">News</h2>`.\n",
    "- If the header isn't displaying the nested contents, click the arrow beside it to expand it, and then hover over the line `<h2 class=\"module-title\">News</h2>`.\n",
    "    - Notice how the highlighted portion of the above site has become smaller? That's because we're now looking at an element that is nested inside of a container, instead of the full container.\n",
    "        - This is a great way to pinpoint where on the website we want our web scraping code to pull data from. We can't just tell the code to grab a div or a header though, because there could be many of these on the website when we only want one. This is where the class and id attributes come into play.\n",
    "\n",
    "### HTML Classes and IDs\n",
    "Because of how quickly HTML code can get bloated and confusing, it's important to keep specific containers unique. With everything contained within HTML code, it can be really difficult to find what we're looking for.\n",
    "\n",
    "But how are developers able to distinguish one `<div />` from another? \n",
    "- By adding attributes unique to each container or element. \n",
    "  \n",
    "  That's another reason to practice using DevTools. We can use it to search for these attributes. How exactly do they work?\n",
    "\n",
    "  Think of it like a litter of puppies. They all look pretty similar, but they each have a personality quirk or trait that makes them act a little differently from their siblings. By adding a different color collar to each puppy, we can now tell them apart just by looking. HTML class and id attributes are like those collars.\n",
    "\n",
    "Robin knows that she will want to pull the top article and summary sentence. How do we identify those components, though? Let's look at our DevTools again. This time, let's drill further down into the nested components—we want to find the element that highlights only the top article on the page.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first `<li />` element with a class of \"slide\" highlights the top article on the page.\n",
    "- Using the DevTools to select a list element with the class of \"slide\" will also highlight the article image, title, and paragraph on the NASA news webpage.\n",
    "\n",
    "The section we're aiming for (the article title and text) is nested further in, and there are quite a few steps we'll need to take to get there.\n",
    "- First, click the drop-down arrow on the `<li class=”slide”>` element (if it isn't already open).\n",
    "- From there, we're directed to another element: a div with the class of \"image_and_description_container.\" \n",
    "- Click that drop-down arrow as well. \n",
    "- Within that, we have another element, `<div class=”list_text”>`.\n",
    "  - Using DevTools to select an element with a class of \"list_text\" will only highlight the article title and paragraph on the NASA news webpage. \n",
    "\n",
    "Maneuvering around these nested elements is called \"drilling down,\" and it's a skill you'll encounter and employ fairly often as you continue to work with HTML.\n",
    "\n",
    "This final container holds the information Robin will want: the article title and summary. With the use of DevTools, we've been able to sift through the nested HTML code to find the exact tags we'll need to reference in our scraping script. \n",
    "- This process is something we'll be following with each additional webpage we want to scrape: visit the page, identify the data, then shift through the HTML code to pinpoint its location on the webpage.\n",
    "\n",
    "That is a lot of clicking to get to one single section of a webpage. With our advanced technology is, isn't there a faster way? You bet! Let's condense the steps above.\n",
    "\n",
    "Go ahead and close your dev tools window, then take another look at the webpage. \n",
    "- Locate the first article's title and summary, and right-click the space below them. This time, click \"inspect\" from the pop-up menu.\n",
    "- The dev tools window automatically opens again, but this time the highlighted section is already closer to the element you want to view, if it isn't already selected. \n",
    "  - You can tell by mousing over the highlighted element—it will simultaneously highlight the corresponding location on the webpage.\n",
    "\n",

    "### Scrape the Top 10 Tags\n",
    "Interacting with webpages is Splinter's specialty, and there are lots of things to interact with on this one, such as the login button and tags. Our goal for this practice is to scrape the \"Top Ten tags\" text.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we start with the code, we'll want to use the DevTools to look at the details of this line. \n",
    "- Right-click the webpage and select \"Inspect.\" From the DevTools window, we can actually select an element on the page instead of searching through the tags.\n",
    "\n",
    "   1. First, select the inspect icon (the one to the far left).\n",
    "   2. Then, click the element you want to select on the page, such as the humor tag. This will direct your DevTools to the line of code the humor tag is nested in.\n",
    "  \n",
    "That was really quick. Sometimes we'll still have to dig through the tags to find the ones we want, but being able to select items directly from the webpage helps scale down time immensely. So with this shortcut, we've been able to select the `<h2 />` tag holding the text we want.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "With this, we know that our data is in an `<h2 />` tag, and that's great! We've narrowed down where our data is hanging out. But what if there is more than one `<h2 />` tag on the page? When scraping one particular item, we will often need to be more specific in choosing the tag we're scraping from. We can narrow this down even further by using the search function in our DevTools.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Search for Elements\n",
    "Searching within the HTML code is another useful way to quickly find items we're looking for. Earlier, we were able to select a particular component from the page with the select tool. But there are times where we need to know how many of a certain type of tag are in the page. \n",
    "For example, the title we want to scrape is in an `<h2 />` tag, but there are several others on the page as well. Knowing this, we can expect to tailor our code to pull only the `<h2 />` tag we want. First, let's practice searching in the HTML.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. With the DevTools still active, press Command + F if you use a Mac, or CTRL + F if you use a Windows computer. \n",
    "   - This activates the search functionality, only instead of searching the webpage, we're searching the HTML of the webpage. So if we search for all of the `<h2 />` tags in the document, we'll know if we need to make our search more specific by adding attributes such as a class name or an id.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. In the search bar that we just activated, type h2 and then press Enter on your keyboard.\n",
    "   - The result of our search immediately shows us two things: \n",
    "      i. That the first tag we've searched for is highlighted.\n",
    "      ii. The number of those tags in the document.\n",
    "   - We receive our first results matching \"h2.\" The total tags with \"h2\" appear in the lower right.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because there is only \"1 of 1\" h2 tags in the document, we know that we can scrape for an `<h2 />` without being more specific. In most other cases, we'll need to include a class or id, so we'll practice that in a little bit.\n",

    "- Now we've parsed all of the HTML on the page. That means that BeautifulSoup has taken a look at the different components and can now access them. Specifically, BeautifulSoup parses the HTML text and then stores it as an object.\n",
    "- In our code, we're using `‘html.parser’` to parse the information, but there are other options available as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. In our next cell, we will find the title and extract it.\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   # Scrape the Title\n",
    "   title = html_soup.find('h2').text\n",
    "   title\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "What we've just done in the last two lines of code is:\n",
    "\n",
    "- We used our `html_soup` object we created earlier and chained `find()` to it to search for the `<h2 /> ` tag.\n",
    "- We've also extracted only the text within the HTML tags by adding `.text` to the end of the code.\n",

    "### Scrape All of the Tags\n",
    "\n",
    "Using our DevTools again, look at the code for the tags. We want all of the tags instead of just one, so we want to first use our select tool to highlight the `<div />` container that holds all of the tags.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that the `<div />` container holding all of the tags has two classes. \n",
    "1. The `col-md-4` class is a Bootstrap feature.   \n",
    "   - **Bootstrap** is an HTML and CSS framework that simplifies adding functional components that look nice by default. \n",
    "     - In this case, `col-md-4` means that this webpage is using a grid layout, and it's a common class that many webpages use. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The other class, tags-box, looks custom, though. Let's make sure first by searching for it using our search box.\n",
    "   - After searching for tags-box, we can see that only one result is returned. This means that it's unique in the HTML and can be used to locate specific data. Next, expand the tags-box div to take a look at the contents.\n",
    "     - From here, we can see a list of `<span />` elements, each with a class of tag-item. \n",
    "       - Open some of the `<span />` elements to see what they contain; if you see `<a />` elements with the names in the list that we're targeting, then we're in the right place.\n",
    "   - Since there are 10 items in the list displayed in the browser, let's use the dev tools' search function to verify the list item count. \n",
    "     - Search for `tag-item` and note the number of returned results. If there are 10, then we're ready to go.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. In the next cell of your Jupyter Notebook, type the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   # Scrape the top ten tags\n",
    "   tag_box = html_soup.find('div', class_='tags-box')\n",

    "   for tag in tags:\n",
    "      word = tag.text\n",
    "      print(word)\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "This code looks really similar to our last, but we've increased the difficulty a bit by incorporating a for loop, but let's start at the beginning.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The first line, `tag_box = html_soup.find('div', class_='tags-box')`, creates a new variable `tag_box`, which will be used to store the results of a search. \n",
    "  \n",
    "  - In this case, we're looking for `<div />` elements with a class of tags-box, and we're searching for it in the HTML we parsed earlier and stored in the `html_soup` variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The second line, `tags = tag_box.find_all('a', class_='tag')`, is similar to the first but with a few tweaks to make the search more specific. \n",
    "  - The new \"tags\" variable will hold the results of a `find_all`, but this time we're searching through the parsed results stored in our `tag_box` variable to find `<a />` elements with a tag class.\n",
    "  - We used `find_all` this time because we want to capture all results, instead of a single or specific one.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Next, we've added a for loop. \n",
    "  - This for loop cycles through each tag in the tags variable, strips the HTML code out of it, and then prints only the text of each tag.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Scrape Across Pages\n",
    "Now that we've practiced scraping items from a single page, we're going to up the ante by scraping items that span multiple pages. Our next section of code will scrape the quotes on the first page, click the \"Next\" button, then scrape more quotes and so on until we have scraped the quotes on five pages.\n",

    "<em>Robin is pretty excited about all of the data we've managed to scrape. And the code is designed to grab the most recent data, so if it's run at a later time, all of the results will have been updated—without us needing to alter the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that she has the results she wants, she needs to store them in a spot where they can be easily accessed and retrieved as needed. SQL isn't a good option because it works with tabular data, and only one of the items we scraped is presented in that format. Even then, it's all condensed into a block of HTML code.\n",
    "\n",
    "What Robin will need to use is a database that works differently from SQL with its neatly ordered tables and relationships. Mongo, a NoSQL database, is designed for exactly this task. While Robin is familiar with SQL databases, Mongo is completely new and we'll need to practice with it before loading in our scraped data.</em>\n",
    "\n",
    "The data Robin has gathered for her web app is great. She's been able to pull a great image, the most recent news article summary, and even an HTML table. Each data type is different, though, with text and images and HTML all together. Compared to SQL's orderly relational system, where each table is linked to at least one other by a key, the data we've helped Robin gather is a bit chaotic. This is where a non-relational database comes in.\n",
    "\n",
    "**MongoDB (Mongo for short) is a non-relational database that stores data in Binary JavaScript Object Notation (JSON), or BSON format.** We'll access data stored in Mongo the same way we access data stored in JSON files. This method of data storage is far more flexible than SQL's model. If you'd like to dig into MongoDB at a deeper level, check out the [official documentation](https://docs.mongodb.com/)\n",
    "\n",
    "- **JSON, JavaScript Object Notation**, is a method that sorts and presents data in the form of key:value pairs. It looks much like a Python dictionary and can be traversed through using list notation.\n",

    "A Mongo database contains collections. These collections contain documents, and each document contains fields, and fields are where the data is stored.\n",
    "\n",
    "While Mongo and SQL are both databases, that's where the similarities end. They handle documents differently, the storage model isn't even close, and we even interact with them in very different ways.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. To get started with Mongo, first open a new terminal window, but make sure your working environment is activated. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Then, to start an instance, type `mongod` into the first line of your terminal and press return or enter on your keyboard. Some Mac users may not need to run this command as Mongo is already running in the background.\n",
    "   - We need to keep this tab open and active so that the Mongo instance continues to run. While Mongo does have a GUI, similar to pgAdmin for Postgres, we'll be using a command line interface (CLI) to make connections within the database.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. In our terminal, create a second window or tab to use for working in Mongo. Again, make sure your environment is active.\n",
    "   - On the first line of this new window, type \"mongo.\" This is done in a new window because, after you execute the command, you cannot use the terminal for other tasks—only to send information to and from the database.\n",

    "- The third line says that to use the scraping code, we will convert from Jupyter notebook to Python.\n",

    "def index():\n",
    "   mars = mongo.db.mars.find_one()\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- This route, `@app.route(\"/\")`, tells Flask what to display when we're looking at the home page, index.\n",
    "  - html (index.html is the default HTML file that we'll use to display the content we've scraped). This means that when we visit our web app's HTML page, we will see the home page.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Within the `def index():` function the following is accomplished:\n",
    "\n",
    "  - `mars = mongo.db.mars.find_one()` uses PyMongo to find the \"mars\" collection in our database, which we will create when we convert our Jupyter scraping code to Python Script. We will also assign that path to the `mars` variable for use later.\n",
    "\n",
    "  - `return render_template(\"index.html\"` tells Flask to return an HTML template using an index.html file. We'll create this file after we build the Flask routes.\n",
    "\n",
    "  - `, mars=mars)` tells Python to use the \"mars\" collection in MongoDB.\n",
    "\n",
    "**This function is what links our visual representation of our work, our web app, to the code that powers it.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Our next function will set up our scraping route. This route will be the \"button\" of the web application, the one that will scrape updated data when we tell it to from the homepage of our web app. It'll be tied to a button that will run the code when it's clicked.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's add the next route and function to our code. In the editor, type the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "@app.route(\"/scrape\")\n",
    "def scrape():\n",

    "  - This route, `“/scrape”`, will run the function that we create just beneath it.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The next lines allow us to access the database, scrape new data using our `scraping.py` script, update the database, and return a message when successful. Let's break it down.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - First, we define it with `def scrape():`.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Then, we assign a new variable that points to our Mongo database: `mars = mongo.db.mars`.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Next, we created a new variable to hold the newly scraped data: `mars_data = scraping.scrape_all().` \n",
    "     - In this line, we're referencing the scrape_all function in the scraping.py file exported from Jupyter Notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Now that we've gathered new data, we need to update the database using `.update()`. Let's take a look at the syntax we'll use, as shown below:\n",
    "\n",
    "      `.update(query_parameter, data, options)`\n",
    "\n",
    "      - We're inserting data, so first we'll need to add an empty JSON object with `{}` in place of the `query_parameter`. \n",
    "  \n",
    "     - Next, we'll use the data we have stored in `mars_data`.\n",
    "  \n",
    "     - Finally, the option we'll include is `upsert=True`. \n",
    "       - This indicates to Mongo to create a new document if one doesn't already exist, and new data will always be saved (even if we haven't already created a document for it).\n",
    "  \n",
    "     -  The entire line of code looks like this: \n",
    "         `mars.update({}, mars_data, upsert=True)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Finally, we will add a redirect after successfully scraping the data: `return redirect('/', code=302)`. \n",
    "     - This will navigate our page back to `/` where we can see the updated content.\n",
    "\n",
    "The final bit of code we need for Flask is to tell it to run. Add these two lines to the bottom of your script and save your work:\n",

Flask templating works because Flask already \"knows\" what to look for (such as a \"templates\" folder and not a \"Templates\" folder); so, if either the capitalization or spelling is off, Flask won't recognize them.

Another example is when content is reorganized based on screen size: three items in a horizontal line on a large screen becomes three items stacked on top of each other when viewed on a small screen.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's extremely popular and comes with loads of built-in components that make designing a webpage a much simpler process. Before we can do anything, we'll need to add Bootstrap's content delivery network (CDN) to our HTML.\n",
    "  - **A CDN is a group of servers that work together to provide users with content.**\n",
    "    -  In Bootstrap's case, it means that we use the Bootstrap data that lives on those servers and pick and choose what we need for our project.\n",

    "An alternative to using a CDN is to download all of the components to our computers, which takes up space on our machines. Since we're only using a few of the components, it's more efficient to use the CDN.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### IMPORTANT\n",
    "Like many tech tools and coding languages, Bootstrap has many different versions of release. We'll be using Bootstrap 3 to customize Robin's web app because it's a stable release.\n",
    "\n",
    "When developers designate a version of their product as \"stable,\" they're saying that this version has been thoroughly tested and is as bug-free as possible. Newer releases are often getting kinks worked out, which can often lead to more research and time spent debugging your code.\n",

In the sample image above, we have our \"Mission to Mars\" title and Scraping button inside the Jumbotron. This way, both items are front and center on the web app.\n",

    "Now we've built our Jumbotron, let's add the main text. The next level of nesting, within the Jumbotron div, is where we'll add the main text and the button we'll use to run our scraping script.\n",
    "\n",
    "We already know that we want the highest-level header, so let's add an `<h1 />` tag. We also know that Robin wants to scrape data with the click of a button, so we'll add that too.\n",

    "    </div>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The `<h1 />` tag is pretty straightforward. We don't need to dress it up at all because the Jumbotron is already doing that for us. The button is a little more complex, though.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we added a `<p />` tag to the Jumbotron, without any classes. This is because it's only there to help with formatting; it helps styling the content within the tag. Then we've added an `<a />` tag with a few different classes included.\n",
    "\n",
    "The \"btn btn-primary btn-lg\" classes are also part of Bootstrap's button component (we're using Bootstrap to create a button instead of the `<button />` tag and element). There are three classes here because we're telling Bootstrap that we're using a button (btn), it's the primary color (btn-primary), and it's large (btn-lg).\n",
    "\n",
    "An `<a />` tag is specifically used to link to other things, so we've also included the href (hypertext reference). The href is the link to another document or webpage. In our case, we're linking it to another component of our page, \"/scrape\".\n",
    "\n",
    "We've added a `role=\"button\"` role so that the webpage knows this link functions as a button, not as a regular hyperlink. This just boils down to aesthetics, though.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `role=\"button\"` is required for screen readers, which are devices that assist people with vision impairments while they visit webpages. When a screen reader encounters `role=\\\"button,\\\"` it will know that it has found a button and not a simple anchor element (`<a />`).\n",

    "### Add the Mars News Article and Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "Next we'll add in the news article and summary and use the grid system that Bootstrap offers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bootstrap Grid is a very useful tool because it provides extremely flexible and customizable layouts for all of your HTML components. It consists of a column and row layout with up to 12 columns per row. We're not required to use every column available, and we can mix and match how many items fit into a row.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's also responsive, which means that it will adapt to whatever browser is being used to view content. Whether the app is viewed on a laptop, a desktop computer, or a tablet, the webpage content will adjust to best fit the screen size. We'll experiment with this as we continue to build the web app.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the article and its summary, we'll want it to sit right under the header and span across the page. To span the entire page, we'll utilize all 12 of the grid columns. Let's set the grid up first.\n",
    "\n",
    "Under the header, add a comment for clarity. This way we'll know where the code for each component is.\n",
    "\n",
    "`<!-- Mars News -->`\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we can add the code, which will be more complex than what we've written so far in HTML. There are a lot of nested tags, so we'll add one at a time and discuss them as we go.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, create a new div with a class of \"row\" and an id of \"mars-news\".\n",
    "\n",
    "    <div class=\"row\" id=\"mars-news\">\n",
    "    </div>\n",
    "\n",
    "By adding a class of \"row\" we're telling Bootstrap that we're about to use the grid system and everything within this div will be horizontally aligned. The id \"mars-news\" helps us select it later if we want to customize it later with CSS.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next we'll add a tag that specifies how many columns this component will be using. We want the article and summary to span the width of the page, so we'll use all columns. Update your code as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "    <div class=\"row\" id=\"mars-news\">\n",
    "        <div class=\"col-md-12\">\n",
    "\n",
    "        </div>\n",
    "    </div>\n",
    "\n",
    "The `col-md-12` means that we want to use 12 columns scaled to a midsize desktop display.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### HINT\n",
    "Now we'll add the `media` portion: the article and summary. Because it's a news source, we want it to be displayed as media. There are two more tags we'll add to achieve this, so let's update our code with them.\n",
    "\n",
    "    <div class=\"row\" id=\"mars-news\">\n",
    "      <div class=\"col-md-12\">\n",
    "        <div class=\"media\">\n",

    "      </div>\n",
    "    </div>\n",
    "  \n",
    "With this update, we've nested in two more tags: one with a class of \"media\" and one with a class of \"media-body.\" First, this tells Bootstrap that we want our content to be displayed as media, and then we insert the media within the body. Bootstrap already has the custom CSS set up for these classes. Now our setup is complete and we can add the article title and summary.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we'll add a header, this time a second-level one, so this section has a title. Nest the following `<h2 />` tag directly inside the media-body `<div />`.\n",
    "\n",
    "    <h2>Latest Mars News</h2>\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we need to add the name of the article we scraped. This is where Flask comes into play. We'll use a fourth-level header for the title of the article, placed beneath the `<h2 />` element we just created. We'll use double curly brackets to insert the title of the news article.\n",
    "\n",
    "    <h4>{{mars.news_title}}</h4>\n",
    "\n",
    "The `mars.news_title` follows the syntax `document.variable_name:` In our scraping code, we saved the title of the article we scraped to the \"news_title\" variable and stored that in the mars Mongo document. When Flask encounters these curly brackets, it then looks to the string (in this case, a variable) stored within them and replaces the variable with the data it holds.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the title is also part of the section we're styling with media classes, we'll want it to also follow suit. By adding class=“media-body” to the `<h4>` element, we're again telling Bootstrap to apply specific styling to the header. The final line of code will look like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "    <h4 class=\"media-heading\">{{mars.news_title}}</h4>\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's add the article summary the same way, only using paragraph tags. We're going to make use of Flask's ability to interpret the string within the double curly brackets again, this time to replace the variable with the paragraph text we scraped earlier.\n",
    "\n",
    "    <p>{{ mars.news_paragraph }}</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "We didn't add any classes or ids to this paragraph tag because the default text is fine. If we want to change its appearance later, we can add our own CSS stylesheet.\n",
    "\n",
    "All together with proper nesting, our code should look like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "    <!-- Mars News -->\n",
    "    <div class=\"row\" id=\"mars-news\">\n",
    "        <div class=\"col-md-12\">\n",
    "          <div class=\"media\">\n",
    "            <div class=\"media-body\">\n",
    "              <h2>Latest Mars News</h2>\n",
    "              <h4 class=\"media-heading\">{{mars.news_title}}</h4>\n",
    "              <p>{{mars.news_paragraph}}</p>\n",

    "### Add the Featured Image\n",
    "Now we'll add the featured image that we scraped. This time, we want the image and the table of Mars facts to be next to each other, so we won't use the full 12 columns on the image. First, let's add a comment so we know which piece of data we're inserting.\n",
    "\n",
    "`<!-- Featured Image -->`\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we'll add the code that'll insert the image. We'll make use of an `<img />` tag, but instead of a string within the src= parameter, we'll use Flask's ability to interpret strings (just like we did when we added the news article and paragraph).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's walk through these lines and how they've been assembled.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each new item we're inserting now is on its own row, so the very first div will have a class of \"row.\"\n",

    "    <div class=\"row\" id=\"mars-featured-image\">\n",
    "\n",
    "    </div>\n",

    "We also added an id for later customization: “mars-featured-image”. This is so we can reference it using CSS if we want to fine-tune the appearance later.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we'll add the div for the rows—eight this time. The number of columns must total 12, so we'll use the four remaining columns for the table data (which we'll add later).\n",
    "\n",
    "    <div class=\"row\" id=\"mars-featured-image\">\n",
    "      <div class=\"col-md-8\">\n",
    "\n",
    "      </div>\n",
    "    </div>\n",
    "    \n",
    "Now we're going to add the code to insert the image. Add the following to your code:\n",
    "\n",
    "    <h2>Featured Mars Image</h2>\n",
    "    <img src=\"{{ mars.featured_image }}\" class=\"img-responsive\" alt=\"Responsive image\">\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we use an `<h2 />` element to add the title for this section: Featured Mars Image.The next line inserts an image using the `<img />` tag, but the tag alone won't actually insert the image. We also need to include the source, or link to where the image is. We do this by adding src=\"{{ mars.featured_image }}\"—notice that we're once again using Flask's ability to interpret strings here.\n",
    "\n",
    "When we add class=\"img-responsive,\" we're using another built-in Bootstrap component that makes the image responsive. That means that the size of the image varies depending on the browser used, without us having to add extra code to do so.\n",
    "\n",
    "The last portion, alt=\"Responsive image,\" adds alt-text to our image. Alt-text is just text that will appear if the image doesn't load, or will be read by a screen reader if one is used. The benefit of alt-text lies in accessibility: visually impaired users will have the opportunity to better understand a webpage without actually viewing the image on it.\n",
    "\n",
    "This final block of code should look similar to the one below:\n",

    "      <div class=\"row\" id=\"mars-featured-image\">\n",

    "- There are links to your presence everywhere—LinkedIn, GitHub, email, etc.\n",
    "- It's personable, and after adding your personal touch, it will be more so.\n",

    "Feel free to use this or one of the other templates to start building a portfolio. Follow the prompts within the code to customize it with your own images and links. The basic portfolios here are a great start, but feel free to make adjustments or add your own flair. Fonts, colors, image sizes—there are few limitations on what you can do.\n",

    "### Customize the Portfolio\n",
    "\n",
    "This portfolio template already links to Bootstrap 4.3.1, but it also has a custom stylesheet included. To change the background of the body, for example, navigate to that style sheet and add this line:\n",
    "\n",
    "   body {\n",
    "      margin: 5px;\n",
    "      padding-bottom: 70px;\n",
    "      background-color: darkgray;\n",
    "   }\n",
    "\n",
    "Save the stylesheet, then refresh your browser. Notice that the background is dark gray instead of white? Each element in your HTML can be adjusted this way.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some tips to help with customizing:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Your featured images should be .png files generated from the project you're featuring, such as a graph made in Matplotlib, a visual you've created that represents the project, or an interesting screenshot of your work.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Sometimes the Bootstrap CSS customization needs to be overwritten. To ensure your stylesheet's code takes precedence, add !important; to the line of code you want changed, like in the code below.\n",
    "  \n",
    "      body {\n",
    "      margin: 5px;\n",
    "      padding-bottom: 70px;\n",
    "      background-color: darkgray !important;\n",
    "      }\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Images can be used as backgrounds. Just be careful that they don't distract from your featured projects.\n",
    "- Background images and colors aren't the only way to add personal touch—free fonts such as [Google Fonts](https://developers.google.com/fonts/docs/getting_started) are also great.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are loads of great resources on CSS customization out on the web, too, for any other specific questions you may have.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Add Your Portfolio to GitHub\n",
    "\n",
    "Your portfolio is something you'll want several other projects linked to. As such, it's best to keep it in its own repository.\n",
    "\n",
    "From your GitHub homepage, create a new repository named \"portfolio\" and clone it into the master folder containing all of your class projects. Download one of the portfolio templates into this folder, then customize it to fit you-your personality, goals, and favorite projects."
